** NUMBER OF BUNDLES **
Number of mini-bundles used.
Each minibundle has 7 fibres.

VALUE RANGE:
If OBSERVING MODE=LCB:
    default = 8 bundles = 56 fibers
    maximum = 89 bundles = 56 + 567 = 623 fibers
    minimum = 1 bundle = 7 fibers
IF OBSERVING MODE=MOS:
    default = 92 bundles = 644 fibers
    maximum = 92 bundles = 644 fibers
    minimum = 1 bundle = 7 fibers

The bundles of 8 robotic actuators (56 fibers), located at the corners of the MOS FoV, are used to measure the sky when in the LCB observing mode. They are projected at different positions along the pseudo-slit to estimate projection effects and different transmissions of instrument depending on the spectrum position in the detector.
