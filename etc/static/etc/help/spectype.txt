** INPUT SPECTRUM **
IF "Input flux" is "Line + Continuum",
then
"Sc" becomes "Sc (smooth)",
"NGC1068" becomes "NGC1068 (smooth)",
"Orion" becomes "Orion (smooth)",
"PN" becomes "PN (smooth)",
"Sy2" becomes "Sy2 (smooth)",
"Starburst1" becomes "Starburst1 (smooth)",
"Starburst2" becomes "Starburst2 (smooth)",
"Starburst3" becomes "Starburst3 (smooth)",
"Starburst4" becomes "Starburst4 (smooth)",
"Starburst5" becomes "Starburst5 (smooth)",
"Starburst6" becomes "Starburst6 (smooth)",
where a continuum fit has been performed to remove spectral lines.
