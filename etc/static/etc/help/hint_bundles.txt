Note: changing the observing mode (from LCB IFU to MOS or vice versa) will reset the fields to their default values.

The number of "SKY" vs "TARGET" bundles/fibers are complementary
and are calculated automatically when one of the entry is set by the user.

In the case of LCB IFU, we deal with FIBERS:
SKY + TARGET = 623 fibers.

In the case of MOS, we deal with BUNDLES:
SKY + TARGET = 92 bundles.
