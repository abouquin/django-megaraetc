** UPLOAD FILE **
File upload works only when SOURCE TYPE is set to POINT.

The file should be prepared in csv format,
with 3 columns: a name, the UBVRI filter band,
and the AB magnitude in that band.
The characters '# (sharp)' are considered as comments
and are not read by the program.

EXAMPLE:

#name,UBVRI,ABmag
V* T Dra,B,18.08
LHS 1903,V,12.21
GD 299,B,11.824
