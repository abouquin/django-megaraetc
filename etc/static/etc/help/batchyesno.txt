** BATCH PROCESS **
works only when set to 'YES'
(the text field below the buttons should activate itself)
and when SOURCE TYPE is set to POINT SOURCE.

You can copy/paste your input data in the text field,
in the following three-columns format:
(1) a target name (2)the UBVRI filter band, and (3)the Vega magnitude of the target in that band.
The columns should be separated by COMMAS.

All '# (sharp)' character are considered as a comments
and are not read by the program.


INPUT EXAMPLE:
#name, band, Vegamag
V* T Dra,B,18.08
LHS 1903,V,12.21
GD 299,B,11.824



CAUTION:
there is an upper limit of 500 to the number of line that can be inputted in the text field.
Each line counts, therefore, we recommend that you do not add a header in the text field (since it would count as a line).
Be careful also to empty lines masqueraded as blank space.
