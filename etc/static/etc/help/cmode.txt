** CALCULATION MODE **
Choices:
- Exposure time to SNR: input the exposure time per frame and output the SNR (default).
- SNR to exposure time(1)(2)(3): input the total SNR you wish to reach and output total exposure time and exposure time per frame for each zone (per voxel, aa, integrated spectrum), rounded to unit second.

(1) Caution: the calculations of the best exposure time are done using the so-called bisection method via multiple (maximum 20) iterations for each case (per voxel, aa, integrated spectrum), and thus, takes longer to complete.
(2) In the case of really bright source (< 12 mag), it is better to use a high value for the "Total SNR".
(3) Exposure times of less than 1 second (Megara's minimum limit is 1 second) are shown as the string '< 1'.
