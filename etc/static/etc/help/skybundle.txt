** NUMBER OF SKY FIBERS (BUNDLES for MOS mode) **
In LCB mode, the default is 56 fibers.
In MOS mode, the default is 8 bundles.

VALUE RANGE:
If OBSERVING MODE=LCB:
    default = 8 bundles = 56 fibers
    maximum = 8 + 81 bundles = 89 bundles = 56 + 567 = 623 fibers
    minimum = 1 bundle = 7 fibers
IF OBSERVING MODE=MOS:
    default = 92 bundles = 644 fibers
    maximum = 92 bundles = 644 fibers
    minimum = 1 bundle = 7 fibers

The bundles of 8 robotic actuators (56 fibers), located at the corners of the
MOS FoV, are used to measure the sky when in the LCB observing mode.
They are projected at different positions along the pseudo-slit to estimate
projection effects and different transmissions of instrument depending on the
spectrum position in the detector.
