** INPUT SPECTRUM **
Choose an input source spectrum template.

NOTES:
    IF "Input flux" is "Line + Continuum",
    then
    "Sc" becomes "Sc (smooth)",
    "NGC1068" becomes "NGC1068 (smooth)",
    "Orion" becomes "Orion (smooth)",
    "PN" becomes "PN (smooth)",
    "Sy2" becomes "Sy2 (smooth)",
    "Starburst1" becomes "Starburst1 (smooth)",
    "Starburst2" becomes "Starburst2 (smooth)",
    "Starburst3" becomes "Starburst3 (smooth)",
    "Starburst4" becomes "Starburst4 (smooth)",
    "Starburst5" becomes "Starburst5 (smooth)",
    "Starburst6" becomes "Starburst6 (smooth)",
    where a continuum fit has been performed to remove spectral lines.
